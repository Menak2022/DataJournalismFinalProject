Though California is saturated with Starbucks, colleges and universities campuses severely lack Starbucks locations. With this dataset, I decided to look at California Universities with 20,000 students or more to find out the closest Starbucks location to each campus. Using google maps, I located Starbucks that are in a 1 mile radius of 19 schools, finding that UC Berkeley has the longest distance to the nearest Starbucks location. The 19 schools analyzed are the following: 
1. University of Southern California
2. University of California-Los Angeles
3. University of California-Berkeley
4. California State University-Fullerton
5. California State University-Northridge
6. California State University-Long Beach
7. University of California-San Diego
8. University of California-Davis
9. San Diego State University
10. University of California-Irvine
11. San Jose State University
12. California State University-Sacramento
13. California State Polytechnic University-Pomona
14. San Francisco State University
15. California State University-Los Angeles
16. University of California-Riverside
17. University of California-Santa Barbara
18. California State University-Fresno
19. California Polytechnic State University-San Luis Obispo
## Scope of Analysis
1. Where in CA is the most Starbucks located?
2. How many are located within 1 mile of CA college with 20k students or more?
3. Which college has the highest starbucks location within 1 mile of campus?
4. Whatâ€™s the walking distance from the campus of CA college with 20k students or more by miles and minutes. 
5. Which college has the furthest walking distance?
